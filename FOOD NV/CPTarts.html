<h1>Caramelised Pepper Tartlets</h1>

<p>Once a week I like to get a big group of friends round and cook. Sitting round a dinner table, catching up on the week, eating some great food is one of my favourite things to do. Feeding 10 people however, is not the easiest thing to do, especially if you have been busy all day, but I find that if you put some sort of starter on the table, your guests are instantly more impressed!!</p>

<p>A key factor in my dinner parties is doing the least amount of washing up as possible. I have usually caused so much of a mess in the kitchen, that washing up starter bowls or plates is just not going to happen, so make something that people can just take off a plate!</p>

<p>These little pepper tarts came about because I had left over pastry from making the Red Onion Tartlets earlier on in the week, I had the cheese and pastry sitting in the fridge all ready to go.</p>

<p>You can prepare the pastry ahead and can keep the cooked pastry cases in an airtight container for a week or so. You can even add the filling the morning of your dinner, and keep them in the fridge ready to heat up before you eat-just remember to take them out of the fridge an hour before you want to heat them.</p>

<p>My friends were impressed and I thought they tasted great so everyone was happy!</p>

<p>Pastry makes: 24-30 depending on the size of your tin and the thickness of the pastry</p>
<p>Topping makes: 12<p>

<ul>
<li>250g plain flour</li>
<li>100g cold, unsalted butter</li>
<li>50g grated parmesan</li>
<li>pinch salt</li>
<li>egg yolk</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
<li>3 peppers of different colours, sliced into long lengths</li>
<li>Boursin/goats cheese</li>
<li>Thyme leaves</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sieve the flour into a mixing bowl with the salt and parmesan.</li>
<li>Add the cubed butter and rub until it looks like breadcrumbs</li>

<li>Add the egg yolk and about 3-4 tbsp&rsquo;s of cold water and mix until a dough comes together.</li>

<li>Wrap the ball of dough in clingfilm and pop in the fridge for at least an hour or so (I left mine in all day)</li>

<li>Butter/oil some muffin/bun tins (I used shallow ones, but if you want bigger tarts then choose bigger sizes)</li>

<li>Roll out the pastry on a floured surface until 1/2cm thick, and cut out rounds to fill your tin. Gently lower the pastry in, and push the edges into the corners. Prick the bottom with a fork so that the pastry doesn&rsquo;t puff up.</li> 

<li>Bake at 180&deg;c for 10-12 minutes, or until the pastry has just coloured.</li>

<li>Meanwhile add the sliced onions and peppers to a pan with some olive oil and cook on a low/medium heat for about 20 minutes. You want everything to be super soft.</li>

<li>This part is a little fiddly!&#x2d;Spoon some onions into the base of the tart, cover with your chosen cheese and then swirl strands of different coloured peppers on top like in the photo!</li>

<li>Sprinkle with some thyme leaves and put in the oven for 5/10 minutes or until the cheese begins to melt. </li>
</ul>
