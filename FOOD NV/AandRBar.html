<p>I promised Christmas bakes and so when a friend of mine (Cameron here is your shout out!) asked me to bake something for his 1st December Christmas party, I thought I would have a go at this one. Christmas jumpers, tinsel and christmas trees headbands are obviously essential attire for Autumn/Winter 2013-getting into the spirit of things!</p>
<p>The inspiration comes from an amazing blogger What Katie Ate, who makes fresh gutsy-flavoured food, jam-packed full of amazing colours and tastes. Unfortunately her sweet baking, as delicious as it is, is not sugar-free, but with a bit of tinkering this recipe went down well even with my friends who had just stuffed themselves full of the first Christmas dinner of the month! </p>

<p>I used frozen raspberries because raspberries are super expensive at this time of year, especially in my local supermarket which likes to charge students ridiculous prices. But of course if you have some delicious fresh raspberries use them! Ground almonds had run out of said useless supermarket all week so I ground up my own, which meant they were a bit more crunchy and I really liked that but if you need something really quick, pre-ground almonds are great to use.</p> 

<p>I&rsquo;ve just enjoyed the last slice for my breakfast on the train this morning, but goes well as a snack or dessert. </p>

<p>Christmas love</p>

<p>Makes 14</p>

<p>For the Pastry:<p>

<ul>
<li>250g plain, white flour</li>
<li>1tsp ground nutmeg</li>
<li>1tsp ground cinnamon</li>
<li>110 g butter, chilled</li>
</ul>
<p>For the Filling:<p>
<ul>
<li>5 apples, cored & chopped</li>
<li>125g frozen raspberries</li>
</ul>
<p>For the Topping</p>
<ul>
  <li>200g ground almonds</li>
<li>100g dates</li>
<li>100g porridge oats</li>
<li>50ml coconut oil, melted</li>
<li>1tsp ground cinnamon</li>
<br>
<p>Method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preheat the oven to 180&deg;c and line a 20x30cm tin with baking parchment.</li> 
<li>Cube the butter in the flour and spices and rub in.</li>

<li>Add 4-5 tbsp of cold water and bring the mixture together into a dough, use more or less water as needed. Bring together and wrap in cling-film and put in the fridge for at least 20 mins</li>

<li>Meanwhile, add the chopped apples and raspberries to a pan with a mug of boiling water. Bring it to the boil and then turn the heat down and leave to simmer, until the fruit had really softened and you are left with a striking pink mush!</li>

<li>Roll out the pastry so that it is a little bigger than the base of your tin. The pastry should come up the sides a little as it will shrink in the oven.</li> 

<li>Prick holes in the base with a fork and put in the oven for about 15 mins or until the base is beginning to brown.</li> 

<li>Meanwhile make the topping by blending the almonds and dates together you get a fine mixture with some small bits of date and almond. Mix with the cinnamon and oats and add the coconut oil.</li> 

<li>Top the pastry with the fruit mixture and then pile on the topping about 1cm thick. You may end up with extra topping, but this pop this in your yoghurt at breakfast- it&rsquo;s delicious!</li>

<li>Bake in the oven for about 25-30 mins, until you can see the topping begin to brown. Do try and leave it in the oven until this happens as it gives it a great crunchy, roasted taste. </li>
</ul>
