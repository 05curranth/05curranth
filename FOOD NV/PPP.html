<p>Porridge has always been a go to breakfast for me. The problem was however, that I would pile a huge bowl full of oats and milk and then pour in a good spoon of golden syrup to sweeten it&#x2d;delicious but never left me feeling that great!</p>

<p>As I have said in the ABOUT section, this blog is very much the start of my journey in discovering what I should and shouldnâ€™t eat so whilst I am strictly refined sugar free, other things like dairy, gluten and meat may leave or come in further down the line. I haven&rsquo;t cut out dairy, but I have definitely reduced the amount that I take in, and I feel a lot better having done so. </p>

<p>Porridge with milk whilst filling me up, would make me bloated and uncomfortable, which is not really the &rsquo;attacking the day&rsquo; type of start I want! When I took out the milk, and used water I felt better but hated the taste. </p>

<p>This recipe idea came after I boiled some fruit one morning for another recipe, and had left over water which tasted so sweet and delicious. I threw in the oats and jumped around the kitchen eating my yummy porridge!</p>

<p>An important thing to remember is to allow the oats to sit in the water for a couple of minutes before you tuck in. It always looks like they won&rsquo;t soak up the water, and it&rsquo;s easy to be tempted to throw in more&#x2d;creating a giant sized portion. Whilst looking like it will fill you up, I find I am even more sluggish on such a huge portion and it really is unnecessary.</p> 

<p>So porridge rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Boil the fruit until soft&#x2d;use whatever fruit you want.</li>

<li>Stick to 1/2 cup of oats&#x2d; it&rsquo;s definitely enough!</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>1 pear (or any fruit, I have used apples and plums before)</li>
<li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
<li>boiling water</li>
1<li>/2 cup oats</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut up the fruit into cm cubes, keep the skin on for extra fibre.</li>

<li>Put the fruit and cinnamon in a pan with enough boiling water to allow the fruit to float in the pan</li>

<li>Boil the fruit until soft</li>

<li>Take the pan off the heat, add the oats and allow to stand for 2 minutes to soak up the liquid.</li> 

<li>Eat and go attack the day!</li>
</ul>
